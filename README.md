# SearchIT
Get it on [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/searchit/fioambgbhedmjhlobdibcbhfjojjccoa).
SearchIT is an extension that is designed to make your life a little bit easier
when you're searching for something on the web. You can see more by checking it
out on the Chrome Web Store.

### What does it do?
Sometimes you want to search the same thing across multiple sites. Search whatever
you want on one of the supported sites, open the extension window, select a site,
and whatever you initially searched will then be searched for on the site that
you selected. You also have the option to open the search in a new tab.

### Why does it need to access my browsing history?
The extension doesn't need access to your browser history per se, but it does
need access to the url to be able to search what you just searched.

### What if I want to install it myself from this source code?
Open extensions in Chrome, turn on developer mode, load in the source as an unpacked extension.

### Can I change modify this or port it to some other browser?
Absolutely! Please let me know so that I can check it out if you do.
